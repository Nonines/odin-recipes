# The Odin Project: Recipes

This is my attempt at [Project: Recipes](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes), the first of [The Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com/) Foundation projects.

It is a very basic HTML project that consists of an html page which contains links to other HTML pages containing Soup recipes.

## Skills demonstrated in this project

* Understanding of HTML and basic HTML elements.
* Links and Images in HTML.
* CSS.
* Git and Github.
* Markdown.
