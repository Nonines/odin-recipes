# The Odin Project: Recipes

This is my 'Recipes' project, the first of [The Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com/) Foundation projects. It is a simple HTML project that consists of an ``index.html`` page which contains links to other HTML pages containing descriptions of Soup recipes as well lists of their ingredients and directions involved in making them.

## Skills I demonstrated in this project
* Basic knowledge of HTML and HTML elements.
* Links and Images in HTML.
* Use cases of ordered and unordered lists in HTML.
* Basic use of Git, as well as the ability to publish a github repository.
* Markdown syntax.
